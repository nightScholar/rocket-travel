Thank you for reviewing my  project. You will need JDK 1.8 to run the applicaiton, all other jars are provided. Below you will find the steps to get the project up and running: 

- Clone the repository to a location of your choice on your machine
- You will need to add the jar files from this repository get everything working (byte-buddy and objenesis are compile dependencies of mockito). You can do this by adding them as    library dependencies for your project through your IDE of choice.
- One you have imported all the needed jars, you should be able to run your application from the Main class. If you're having trouble check that your output folder is configured and you should be set.
